# YouTube-Likes-Prediction
Predicting the "like" count for YouTube videos

This project attempts to see if a linear model can be fitted to build a relationship between the number of views a video gets, the category (or genre) it belongs to and the number of likes it gets. This relationship is used to predict the number of likes a video will get based on its category and number of views.

The YouTube trending video statistics dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset) is a day-wise record for up to 200 trending videos on YouTube across 12 countries. For the purpose of this project though we will only be looking at videos from the USA and only for the year 2021. This dataset is a CSV file with each country having its own file.
